# VtxGridFitter

The VertexGridFitter tool is a tool that looks to fit for the best
reconstructed vertex for the event's muon.  The VertexGridFitter is
different from the VtxFinder tools in that it does not use Minuit to
find the optimal vertex.  Instead, a grid of positions and a grid of
directions are combined to manually search for the position/direction
with the best figure-of-merit.

## Data


## Configuration
SecondPassScale double

After the first pass acros the VtxGridSeed, the grid is used again to
search around the first pass' best position fit.  On the second pass,
the grid is scaled down by the factor of SecondPassScale to make the
position resolution finer.

DirectionPoints int

For each position, an array of direction vectors is used when evaluating
the figure-of-merit.  The direction seeds are generated by populating
points on a unit sphere using Vogel's Method.  The DirectionPoints
integer defines how many points are put onto the sphere.
